## More Particles


</div>

### Description

This is a reworking of 'Geespot_Particles' giving many more options and settings to play with. Becasue this does not use the Shape control you can have many more Particles than before.

This is also a demostration of my ClsUpDown (See other upload 'Decimal Fraction UpDown Class' for explanation).

See http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=41231&lngWId=1 for the code which inspired this.

I think my code is different enough to ask for votes but please vote for GeeSpot as well.

Hope you like it.
